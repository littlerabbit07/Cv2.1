### Step 1: Set Up Your Project Directory

1. Create a new directory for your project. You can name it something like `hello-world-bootstrap`.
2. Inside this directory, create an `index.html` file.

### Step 2: Include Bootstrap

You can include Bootstrap in your project either by using a CDN (Content Delivery Network) or by downloading Bootstrap files. For simplicity, we'll use the CDN method.

### Step 3: Create the HTML Structure

Open the `index.html` file and add the following code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Hello World with Bootstrap</title>
    <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
    <link href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container text-center mt-5">
        <h1 class="display-4">Hello, World!</h1>
        <p class="lead">Welcome to your first Bootstrap web application.</p>
        <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Learn More</a>
    </div>

    <!-- Bootstrap JS and dependencies (optional) -->
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@popperjs/core@2.9.2/dist/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Step 4: Run Your Application

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You should see a simple page displaying "Hello, World!" with a Bootstrap-styled button.

### Explanation of the Code

- **DOCTYPE and HTML Structure**: The document starts with `<!DOCTYPE html>` to define it as an HTML5 document. The `<html>` tag wraps the entire content.
- **Head Section**: This includes the character set, viewport settings for responsive design, the title of the page, and the Bootstrap CSS link.
- **Body Section**: Contains a Bootstrap container with a centered heading, a paragraph, and a button.
- **Bootstrap JS and Dependencies**: The scripts at the bottom include jQuery, Popper.js, and Bootstrap's JavaScript for any interactive components.

### Step 5: Customize (Optional)

You can customize the content, styles, and layout as needed. Bootstrap provides a wide range of components and utilities to enhance your web application.

### Conclusion

You now have a basic web application using Bootstrap with a "Hello World" structure. You can expand upon this foundation by adding more Bootstrap components and custom styles as you develop your application further.
